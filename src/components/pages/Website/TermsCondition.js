						<ol>
							<li>Design risks; errors in data, incorrect assumptions, logical program errors. Even if you designed a perfect strategy, past performance is no guarantee of future results.</li>
							<li>Loss of internet connectivity; resulting in disconnections from brokerage, trades not placed, not seeing the results of algorithm, orders failing to be placed.
							</li>
							<li>Poor design of algorithm; resulting in runaway strategies, machine gun orders, run-time errors halting program operation, failure to trade when expected, termination of the algorithm.</li>
							<li>Unexpected market conditions; resulting in poor fill prices, rapid losses (flash crashes), late exchange openings.</li>
							<li>Data issues; broken, dirty, delayed or intermittent data connections causing algorithm errors. This includes data inaccuracies (exchanges sometimes publish bad/fictional trades).
							</li>
							<li>Execution issues; orders submissions, updates and cancellations could be rejected or delayed. Trades could be disallowed by authorities without warning.
							</li>
							<li>Malicious activities; criminal activity could cause your algorithm to fail or your brokerage account to become compromised, leaking personal information, intellectual property or theft of your funds.</li>
							<li>These events can cause the loss of all funds and holdings in your brokerage account. Algorithmic trading losses can occur faster than in manual trading and you should consult an investment professional to discuss these risks. You should continually monitor the operation of a live trading algorithm to ensure it is running properly.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>EVERY TIME YOU USE THE SITE YOU AGREE THAT IN ALL CASES THE COMPANY BEARS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES INCURRED, AND OFFERS NO GUARANTEES OR EXPECTATIONS ON YOUR ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE OR STABILITY.

						<h5>Risk Disclosure</h5>
						<p>Javelin Tradersis not responsible for any loss, including without limitation, any loss of profit, which might come up directly or indirectly from the use of or the dependence on systems and authorizations provided by us. Javelin Traderscannot be held responsible for the accuracy of any tools, services and systems made accessible through the site.
						</p>
						<p>Any news, analysis, research, opinions, prices, or any other information provided by Javelin Tradersthrough  (blog or YouTube channel) or cannot be established as an investment recommendation. Javelin Traders cannot be held liable for any form of loss or damage, in addition to without limitation, any loss that may be encountered directly or indirectly from the utilization of or dependency on such information.
						</p>
						<p>Trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing one's financial security or lifestyle. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading.
						</p>
						<p>There is a very high degree of risk involved in trading. Past results are not indicative of future returns. Javelintraders YouTube Channel (all languages) and all individuals affiliated with this site or Channel assume no responsibilities for your trading and investment results. The indicators, strategies, columns, articles and all other features are for educational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice. Information for stock/Nifty/Banknifty observations are obtained from our own experience in the market , but we do not warrant its completeness or accuracy, or warrant any results from the use of the information. Your use of the stock/Nifty/Banknifty observations is entirely at your own risk and it is your sole responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, completeness and usefulness of the information. You must assess the risk of any trade with your broker and make your own independent decisions regarding any securities mentioned herein.You must consult your financial advisor before taking any action in the stock market.
						</p>
						<p>Past performance results are shown for illustration and example only, are hypothetical and as such have many inherent limitations. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently significant differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading technique or methodology. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or adhere to a particular trading program despite trading losses are material factors which can adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which can not be fully accounted for in a preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.

						<p>Javelin Traders allows you to engage in live trading using the broker’s API access given to you by the broker. Engaging in live trading subjects you to:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>the risks associated with trading generally, and</li>
							<li>the risks associated with live algorithmic trading using .
								The occurrence of any of the events associated with these risks, alone or in combination with any of the other risks described in this disclosure statement, could result in the loss of all of the money you have deposited in the brokerage account you use for live trading based on the strategies you write, test, and run on . Losses can happen more quickly when using algorithmic trading than other forms of trading. You should discuss with an investment professional the risks of trading in general and algorithmic trading in particular. You use any strategy in live trading at your own risk and it is your obligation to thoroughly and appropriately test any trading strategy before you deploy it and to continually monitor the operation of any deployed trading strategy to ensure it is running properly and in compliance with any applicable rules.
								<ol>
									<li>Any or all of the systems comprising our infrastructure could entirely or partially fail, function erratically, or function very slowly (thereby leading to latency, i.e., delays in receipt of and response to user requests).</li>
									<li>We may inadvertently cause a systems failure during planned or unplanned system maintenance.</li>
									<li>We may undertake software upgrades, either planned or unplanned, that take longer to implement or that causes your computer system or Internet connectivity to fail.</li>
									<li>We may change or remove functions and features whose change or removal causes your system to fail, function erratically, or function very slowly.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<h5>Other technology related terms and conditions:</h5>
							<li>
								Your computer system and your Internet connectivity may fail.
								Any of the components of your computer system and/or your Internet connectivity could fail entirely, function erratically, or function very slowly. The result of any of these occurrences could make it difficult or impossible for you to access the Javelin TradersSite or Services.
								You may incur losses (or fail to gain profits) while trading securities. You should discuss the risks of trading with the broker-dealer where you maintain an account or other investment professional. Javelin Traders provides you only with trading technology and can provide no investment, financial, regulatory, tax or legal advice.

							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Trading algorithms are subject to several risks, any of which can cause your algorithms to not function as you had intended or fail to achieve one or more of the objectives of your algorithms. Algorithmic trading is rapidly changing as a practice and as an industry. Models of markets used to write and test trading algorithms are inherently limited and often fail to perform as expected. In addition, trading algorithms are implemented in software programming code, and no matter how well designed and thoroughly tested, any such code can have logical errors and bugs that cause the algorithms to malfunction or suggest trades that, if executed, would result in losses. It is your obligation to thoroughly and appropriately test any trading algorithm before you deploy it and to continually monitor the operation of any deployed trading algorithm to ensure it is running properly and in compliance with any applicable rules</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Your algorithm may be designed on the basis of an incorrect understanding of technical indicators which may not work as expected.</li>
							<li>Your algorithm may contain logical errors in the way you understand the indicators and comparators.</li>
							<li>Errors may exist in the data used for testing your algorithm or the applicable model of the market.</li>
							<li>Your algorithm might appear to succeed in a backtesting environment using historical data.</li>
							<li>Your algorithm might appear to succeed with some data sources, but fail when using other data sources in our system.</li>
							<li>Your algorithm may not achieve the returns you anticipate. There are no guarantees, or even expectations, that can be made about the future behavior of an algorithm.</li>
							<li>
								<p>Backtesting Cannot Assure Actual Results.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>It is not possible for a computer model to truly predict what might have happened if an algorithm-based trading strategy was in play in a live trading environment. For example, the implementation of such a strategy can itself have an impact on the market, and the model may fail to account for real-life factors that impact the model. Moreover, the model may fail to account for execution costs including broker commissions, fees, and trading slippage.</li>
									<li>A promising model result does not necessarily predict a successful strategy. A backtest might be over-fitted to past data, and fail when the strategy is applied to new, live data. Your algorithm might not handle market conditions that cannot be reasonably anticipated, i.e., a “flash crash” or an exchange outage. These market conditions, by definition, will not have been tested.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>The relevant market might fail or behave unexpectedly. Market centers in which you seek to implement your trading strategy may fail or behave incorrectly because of technical reasons relating to infrastructure, connectivity, and similar factors.
								<ul>
									<li>Your algorithm might suffer from adverse market conditions. Those conditions can include a lack of liquidity and abrupt and unwarranted price swings. Also possible are late market openings, early market closings, market chaos, and mid-day trading pauses, and other such disruptive events.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>You may receive incorrect information, or be unable to get information, about your orders, your positions, or market conditions. Incorrect actions may be taken, or corrective actions may not be taken, because of inaccurate or missing information. In addition, you may be unable to terminate or edit your algorithm.
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Malicious and criminal activities might cause your algorithms and strategy to fail.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>All computers and networks are subject to malicious “hacking” attacks and criminal activities designed to misappropriate the intellectual property, compromise personally identifiable information, steal funds, or any combination of such purposes. These attacks might be attacks on a target of opportunity or specifically targeted. Any such attack could cause the system so attacked to function improperly or not at all and could result in the misappropriation of your intellectual property, the compromise of your personally identifiable information and personal financial information, the theft of your funds and can cause your algo to be misbehave, malfunction or behave erratically. Javelin Traderscannot be held liable and no legal action can be initiated against a forementioned website, in any case of an external attack by a malicious entity that leads to disclosure of personal data, algorithms or any other data a user has created, submitted or stored with . , in any case, be held liable to any loss of intellectual property, content, harm to reputation, damage, etc.</li>
									<li>Javelin Tradersrelies on third party services for market data eg. data streaming via Alice Blue or Zerodha subscribed by you (the user) for ticks, OHLCV, status updates, order execution etc. If these services are down or unsubscribed due to unforeseen circumstances or experience a down time due to various technical / non technical issues, Javelin Tradersmight not be able to execute orders at all.</li>
